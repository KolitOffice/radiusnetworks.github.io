title: iBeacon Locate App Available for Android
---

If you need a tool to help you work with iBeacons using your Android device, we just released a free one in the Google Play store.  The
[iBeacon Locate app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.radiusnetworks.ibeaconlocate&hl=en) works with any device with Android 4.3+ and Bluetooth 4.0.  

The coolest thing about iBeacon Locate is that you can use it to see *anybody's* iBeacons, even if you don't know their UUID.
(This is something that is currently not possible on iOS.)  You can further track down an iBeacon that is nearby using the distance 
feature, which gives you an estimate of the distance to the iBeacon updated in real-time.

And if you have your own iBeacons that you're working with, the tool will let you calculate the calibration values for them directly 
from Android.

This app uses Radius Networks' open source [Android iBeacon Library](http://developer.radiusnetworks.com/ibeacon/android/).
